We create a new nx workspace `npx create-nx-workspace juridev --packageManager=yarn`. You can also use `npm` or `pnpm` if you prefer.

</TimeStamp>

<TimeStamp start="1:52" end="1:58">

To open the new workspace, run `code-insiders juridev/`

To run your project `yarn nx run site:serve`. Keep in mind if you are working with another name, you'll need to replace 'site' for your project name.

You can run your project directly by using `yarn nx serve site`
